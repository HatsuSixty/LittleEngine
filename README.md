# LittleEngine

A simple C++ 2D engine.  
**Please keep in mind that this is primarily for my personal use, and is not a general purpose 2D engine.**

## How to use

**This engine requires that you use raylib.**  
Read [`Docs.md`](./Docs/Docs.md).

## Testing

First, compile the engine + example:
```console
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
```
Then, run the example:
```console
$ ./build/Example/Example
```
